# Store_Sales
Project Overview - A food retailer currently issues summary reports to regional management at the end of each week. Managers feel that the existing process does not enable them to respond quickly enough to issues at store level. The company wishes to implement a solution that provides near-real-time data insights and enables performance to be monitored across multiple. dimensions, such as products and customers.

Data was generated using python. 

Data was then cleaned and data model built using MySQL.

Report was then built using Power BI:
